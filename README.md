        <p>Hi, I’m Keshav, a passionate student and aspiring game developer. My journey into coding started at a young age, and it’s become more than just a hobby—it’s a way for me to challenge myself and create something meaningful. I enjoy learning new things, especially when it comes to game development.</p>
        
        <p>Currently, I’m working on several game projects, all focused on pushing my skills and understanding of game design. I love solving problems, tackling difficult tasks, and diving into complex game mechanics. Every new project is a learning experience, and I’m always eager to improve.</p>
        
        <p>With skills in Python, Scratch, and TinkerCad, I’m building a solid foundation in coding and game creation. My ultimate goal is to become a professional game developer and make a living by creating games that others can enjoy. I’m excited for what’s to come and always on the lookout for new challenges to take on.</p>
